<!-- 
 **Important Considerations & Edits for the Above Template**

*   **`date:`**:  The date the blog post is being created or, ideally, the date of the original video upload (if relevant).
*   **`draft: false`**:  This ensures the post is published. If you want to work on it and not have it public yet, set this to `true`.
*   **`description:`**: Write a concise and compelling description of the post.  This is important for SEO and how the post appears in search results.  Aim for 150-160 characters.  Examples:
    *   "Reliving the iconic moment: A look back at Jawed Karim's "Me at the zoo," the first YouTube video and its lasting impact."
    *   "From pixelated beginnings to global phenomenon: Examining the significance of "Me at the zoo," the groundbreaking first YouTube video."
*   **`tags:`**:  Add relevant tags to help users find your post. Think about keywords related to the video content, the topic, and the platform.  Examples: `["YouTube", "History", "Zoo", "Jawed Karim", "Internet History", "First Video", "Silicon Valley", "San Diego Zoo"]`
*   **`categories:`**:  Choose relevant categories for organization.  Examples: `["Technology", "Internet Culture", "History", "YouTube", "Video Essays"]`
*   **[TRANSCRIPT PLACEHOLDER - manual input required]**:  This is *crucially* where you paste the transcript.

**Enhancements to Consider *After* Inserting the Transcript**

*   **Headings (H2, H3, etc.)**:  Break up the text into logical sections using headings.  This makes the post much more readable.  Example:
    ```markdown
    ## The Video Itself

    [Transcript text discussing the video's content]

    ## The Significance

    [Transcript text discussing the video's importance]
    ```

*   **Paragraphs**:  Ensure the transcript is properly formatted into paragraphs for readability.

*   **Links**:  Add links to relevant websites, YouTube videos, articles, or resources mentioned in the transcript.  For example:
    ```markdown
    As you can see in the video itself, which you can watch here: [Me at the zoo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw)
    ```

*   **Images**:  Embed relevant images to visually enhance the post. You'll need to upload the images to your Hugo `static/` directory (e.g., `static/img/`) and then link to them in the markdown. Example:
    ```markdown
    ![Jawed Karim at the Zoo](/img/jawed_at_the_zoo.jpg)
    ```

*   **Code Snippets**: If the transcript discusses code, use backticks (`) or fenced code blocks (```) to format it properly.

*   **Quotes**:  Use `>` to format quotes from the video or other sources.

*   **Video Embed**: If you want the video to display directly in the post (highly recommended), use Hugo's built-in support for YouTube (or Vimeo, etc.).  This usually involves a shortcode.  Consult your Hugo theme's documentation for the correct way to embed videos. A common method is:

    ```markdown
    {{< youtube jNQXAC9IVRw >}}
    ```

    (Replace `jNQXAC9IVRw` with the actual YouTube video ID).  **You might need to configure your Hugo theme to support YouTube shortcodes.**

*   **Grammar and Style**: Proofread the transcript and correct any grammatical errors or typos.  Adjust the writing style to fit the tone of your blog.  Consider adding a brief introduction and conclusion if the transcript feels abrupt.

*   **Call to Action**:  Encourage readers to leave comments, share the post, or subscribe to your blog.
