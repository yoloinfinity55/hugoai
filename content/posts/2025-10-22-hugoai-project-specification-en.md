## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the project specification for HugoAI, a fully automated system that converts YouTube videos into bilingual Hugo blog posts using AI.

## 2. Project Overview

HugoAI is designed to streamline the content creation process by leveraging AI to generate high-quality blog posts from YouTube videos. The system is built to be efficient, cost-effective, and easy to use, with a focus on automation and seamless integration with the Hugo static site generator and GitHub Pages.

### 2.1. Key Features

- **YouTube Integration**: Extracts video transcripts and metadata.
- **AI Content Generation**: Utilizes Google Gemini AI to create blog posts.
- **Bilingual Support**: Generates content in both English and Chinese.
- **Hugo Integration**: Creates and manages content for a Hugo-based website.
- **Automated Deployment**: Deploys the updated site to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
- **One-Click Processing**: A single command initiates the entire workflow.

### 2.2. Target Audience

This project is intended for content creators, developers, and marketers who want to repurpose video content into blog posts with minimal manual effort.

## 3. System Architecture

The system is composed of several key components that work together to achieve the desired functionality.

### 3.1. Core Components

- **`hugo_manager.py`**: The main Python script that orchestrates the entire workflow.
- **Hugo**: The static site generator used to build the website.
- **Google Gemini AI**: The AI model used for content generation.
- **GitHub Actions**: The CI/CD platform used for automated deployment.

### 3.2. Data Flow

1.  **Input**: The user provides a YouTube URL, title, and author name as command-line arguments to `hugo_manager.py`.
2.  **Transcript Extraction**: The script uses the `youtube-transcript-api` library to fetch the video transcript.
3.  **Content Generation**: The transcript is sent to the Google Gemini AI API to generate blog posts in English and Chinese.
4.  **File Creation**: The generated content is saved as markdown files in the `content/posts` directory.
5.  **Site Build**: The script runs the `hugo` command to build the static site.
6.  **Deployment**: The script commits the new files to the Git repository and pushes them to the main branch, which triggers a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the site to GitHub Pages.

## 4. Technical Details

### 4.1. Python Environment

- **Python Version**: 3.10+
- **Key Libraries**:
    - `google-generativeai`: For interacting with the Gemini AI API.
    - `youtube-transcript-api`: For fetching YouTube transcripts.
    - `yt-dlp`: For downloading video metadata.
    - `python-dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
    - `PyYAML`: For parsing the `config.yaml` file.

### 4.2. Hugo Configuration

- **`config.yaml`**: The main configuration file for the Hugo site. It defines the site's title, base URL, languages, menus, and other settings.
- **`content/posts`**: The directory where the generated blog posts are stored.
- **`layouts`**: Contains the templates for the website's layout and appearance.
- **`static`**: Contains static assets such as CSS and images.

### 4.3. Automation

- **`hugo_manager.py`**: The script is designed to be run from the command line and automates all the steps in the content creation pipeline.
- **GitHub Actions**: The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file defines the CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys the site to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.

## 5. Usage

To use the system, run the following command:

```bash
python3 hugo_manager.py --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --title "Blog Post Title" --author "Your Name"
```

## 6. Future Enhancements

- **Support for more languages**: The system can be extended to support additional languages by adding new prompts and language configurations.
- **Improved AI prompts**: The prompts used for content generation can be further refined to produce even higher-quality content.
- **Web interface**: A web-based interface could be developed to make the system even more user-friendly.
- **Content summarization**: The AI could be used to generate summaries of the blog posts for social media or other channels.
